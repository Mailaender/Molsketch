Short instructions for building the source with CMake:
0. Prepare
- Unpack the source and change to the source dir
- mkdir build
- cd build

1. Using cmake:
- cmake ..
- make
(using Qt5, if available, see below)
1.1 Install the binary (if desired)
- make install
1.2 Make a package (if desired)
- make package

2. Using qmake:
The binary will be in the bin/ subdirectory, the library part in the lib/ subdirectory.
2.1. Qt4
- qmake ..
- make
2.2. Qt5
- qmake-qt5 ..
- make

3. Notes on Qt5 vs. Qt4
If Qt5 is used, library and executable names will be appended with "-qt5" (both cmake and qmake).
With qmake, one can choose the version by picking the appropriate version of qmake.
With cmake, Qt5 is automatically selected, if available, otherwise Qt4. If you have both versions
and want to force the usage of Qt4, use
- cmake -D FORCEQt4=TRUE ..
in the cmake step above.
