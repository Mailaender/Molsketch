<h2>Appendix A. Installation</h2>
molsKetch is designed to work on multiple platforms. It's known to be running on Microsoft Windows, Linux and MacOS X, but it's quite possible it will work on other platforms as well.

<h3>Microsoft Windows</h3>
The easiest way to install molsKetch on Windows is by using the installer. You can find the installer on <a href="http://molsketch.sourceforge.net">http://molsketch.sourceforge.net</a>. Execute the installer and follow the instructions on screen to install molsKetch. 

Of course, compiling from source is also possible on Windows. For more information see "Compiling from source".

<h3>Binary install on Linux</h3>
Binary installation on Linux is possible with packages for the different distributions. At the moment, only a package for Debian is available. You'll have to make sure that the correct dependencies are (being) installed. For molsKetch Hydrogen and Deuterium, you'll need Qt 4.2 runtime and libopenbabel2.

<h3>Compile from source</h3>
The source code of molsKetch is available under the GPL. You can find the source code on <a href="http://molsketch.sourceforge.net">http://molsketch.sourceforge.net</a>. molsKetch uses the CMake build system. Make sure you've installed a recent version. You'll need the OpenBabel library and QT4.2 to compile the source.

To compile the source code:
<ul>
<li>Unpack the source code</li>
<li>Change to the source code directory</li>
<li>Make a new dir "build"</li>
<li>Enter the following commands:
    <ul>
		<li>cmake .. </li>
	    <li>make</li>
		<li>make install</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This should configure, compile and install molsKetch on your system. You can start molsKetch by typing "molsketch" on a command prompt.
</p><p>
Compiling should work under Windows with MinGW, Cygwin or Microsoft Visual Studio, but only MinGW has been tested.</p>
