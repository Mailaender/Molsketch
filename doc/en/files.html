<h2>Chapter 3. Working with files</h2>

After drawing your molecule, you'll want to use it in another document, print it or save it for later use. Of course you can also open or import existing molecules.

<h3>Molecule files</h3>
<h4>Open a file</h4>
You can open a file by selecting the option "Open..." in the file menu or by using the toolbar. The program supports or formats supported by the Open Babel library. This includes popular formats like MOL, SMILES and CML.

<h4>Saving a document</h4>
You can save your document by selecting "Save" from the file menu or by using the toolbar. The program supports or formats supported by the Open Babel library. This includes popular formats like MOL, SMILES and CML. WARNING: molsKetch doesn't support extra information included in some file formats. If you resave an existing file, it is possible you'll loose this data.

<h4>Import a molecule</h4>
If you want to add an existing molecule to your document, you can import it. You can also use this to combine molecules from multiple sources. Use "Import" from the file menu or use the toolbar to achieve this.

<h3>Exporting</h3>
To use your molecule for other purposes, you can export it as an image.

<h4>Saving your document as a bitmap</h4>
You can export your document as a bitmap by using "Export" from the file menu. molsKetch can export your document in a number of formats, like PNG and JPEG. By default, all molecules in your document will be exported to a single bitmap.

<h4>Saving  your document as a vector illustration</h4>
Another option for exporting your document as a image is using a vector format. The advantage of this format is that you won't loose any detail when scaling the picture. Currently, only the Scalable Vector Graphics format is supported. To export as a SVG file, click on "Export" in the file menu. Next enter a name for the file and add the extension .svg.

<h3>Printing</h3>
You can also print the document or export the document as PDF file.

<h4>Printing a document</h4>
You can print the document by selecting "Print" in the file menu. By default, all molecules in the document will scaled to fit on one page.

<h4>Exporting a document as PDF</h4>
To export the document as Portable Document Format (PDF) file, select "Print" from the file menu. Next select "Print to file" and enter a name for the PDF file. By default, all molecules in the document will scaled to fit on one page.
